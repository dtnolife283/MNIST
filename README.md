# 🧮 MNIST Digit Classification

A mini classification project on the **MNIST handwritten digits dataset**, completed as part of a course.  
The project explores two different approaches to building digit classifiers — one implemented from scratch and another using modern deep learning frameworks.

## 📘 Project Overview

This project focuses on classifying handwritten digits (0–9) from the MNIST dataset.  
It is divided into two main parts:

### 1️⃣ From-Scratch Implementation  
- Implemented **Softmax Regression** and a simple **Neural Network** from the ground up (without high-level frameworks).  
- Covered essential concepts including:  
  - Data preprocessing and normalization  
  - Forward and backward propagation  
  - Gradient descent optimization  
  - Evaluation metrics (accuracy, loss visualization)

### 2️⃣ TensorFlow / Keras Implementation  
- Rebuilt the classification pipeline using **TensorFlow** and **Keras** for efficient model training.  
- Explored deeper architectures such as **fully connected** and **convolutional neural networks (CNNs)**.  
- Compared performance with the from-scratch implementation.

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies
- **Languages:** Python  
- **Libraries:** NumPy, Matplotlib, TensorFlow, Keras  
- **Dataset:** MNIST (via `tensorflow.keras.datasets`)
